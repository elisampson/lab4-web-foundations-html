Comp 305, Fall 2025
## Overview
- Hands on practice with HTML
- Usage of many HTML tags outside of obsolete elements 
- Checked work through validator

## Troubleshooting
- Had a problem with my first commit so I pushed it. Hopefully that is ok and I belive I fixed the issue 
- I moved some of my new work to a doc because I was moving things around in my file directory and didn't want to delete my progress. Not trying to cause confusion on my multiple commit messages I did at the beginning
- Tried to shift to a space theme, but some media elements don't match
- Picture tag media not showing up, for whatever I try 
- Noticed a lot of websites block iframes so used wiki
